The goal of this card is to generate commands.json automatically from subjects.xml

# DOD (definition of done):
`commands.json` is generated inside of the code automatically.

# TODO:
- [ ] 1. List what need to be added to `subjects.xml`
- 

# Reports:
* What need to do
> * Keep a copy of `subjects.xml` outside of the package to make it possible to update subjects structures without compiling app
> * Subject handler reads `subjects.xml` from data folder not from package resources
> * Auto generate `commands.json` from `subjects.xml`
> * Keep/read `commands.json` on the data folder
> * somehow track `subject.xml`
> * update tables when `subjects.xml` is changed
