The goal of this card is to push some files (from a list) push to the `develop`branch to the main automatically.

# DOD (definition of done):
A GitHub action is developed and implemented.

# TODO:
- [ ] 1. Create an GitHub action for the `develop` to auto-push files to the `main`

# Reports:
* The current action, `generate-deck.yml` was updated to work only if the branch is `main`. So even the action file is added to other branches such as develop, it does nothing.
> * However I thing removing a file ( in this case an YAML action file) that is not used or ignored makes a repo more clear.
> * For now it will be kept for a while but it will be removed from `develop` when designing actions are completely done.
* A new action name `auto-merge-changes.yml` was added to the `develop`  branch to read a list of files and folders from a file named `.gitautomarge` from the root of the `develop` branch and push them to main automatically after pushing to the `develop`
