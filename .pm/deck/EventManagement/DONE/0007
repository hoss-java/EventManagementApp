The goal of this card is to develop a basic main class with its tests.

# DOD (definition of done):
A main class is created.
Tests are added.
Boths local and remote DI run tests as a part of the workflow
All findings are documented.

# TODO:
- [x] 1. Create the main class
- [x] 2. Recap how work with maven projects

# Reports:
* A basic java app and its basic tests based the calapp was create (https://github.com/hoss-java/calapp-workshop/)
* A simple script was added to repo to make it faster to run maven commands
>```
>#!/bin/sh
>docker exec -it maven mvn -f EventManagementApp/EventManApp "$@"
>```
* Now instead a long commands a shorter command can be used:
>```
># To clean temporary files and caches
>docker exec -it maven mvn -f EventManagementApp/EventManApp clean
># or
>./emrun clean
>
># To compile and creating jar file
>docker exec -it maven mvn -f EventManagementApp/EventManApp compile
>#docker exec -it maven mvn -f EventManagementApp/EventManApp clean compile
># or
>./emrun compile
>./emrun clean compile
>
># To run tests
>docker exec -it maven mvn -f EventManagementApp/EventManApp test
># or
>./emrun test
>
># To Create package
>docker exec -it maven mvn -f EventManagementApp/EventManApp package
># or
>./emrun package
>
># To run main
>docker exec -it maven mvn -f EventManagementApp/EventManApp exec:java
># or
>./emrun exec:java
>```
