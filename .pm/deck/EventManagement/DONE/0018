The goal of this card is to add a new interface for REST service.

# DOD (definition of done):
A REST service interface is added.
The main code is update to run the REST on background.
A simple terminal shell to connect with the REST is coded.

# TODO:
- [x] 1. Add an empty REST service interface
- [x] 2. Develop a script to connect to the REST interface
- [x] 3. Update the REST Interface with needed commands
- [x] 4. Document findings

# Reports:
* A new service called RESTInterface has been created.
* Thanks to the design used for the project, adding a new REST interface was incredibly easy!
* The Maven and CLI containers were updated to support external connections to the service provided by RESTInterface. The Maven container now exposes a range of ports for service setup, and the SSHD container includes Python and its modules for running REST clients.
* Two clients for remote interaction with RESTInterface from the SSHD container have been developed: EMClient.py and EMClient.sh.
* Both clients retrieve command JSON from the server and execute it, similar to the previously developed consoleInterface.
* Note that RESTInterface currently lacks security checks; it executes commands without verifying client credentials.
