The goal of this card is to implement a class for manage events.

# DOD (definition of done):
An event class according the scenario is implemented.

# TODO:
- [x] 1. Add a class skeleton for event
- [x] 2. Impalement a command parser to the class

# Reports:
The goal is to create a class that stores items in a database. Initially, before establishing a database connection layer, the class will retain data in memory as event objects. 

To facilitate migration from memory objects to database records, an `EventObject` class has been defined, which manages the attributes of event objects. The `EventObjectMan` class, built on the `ObjectHandler`, operates in conjunction with `EventObject`. 

The `EventObjectMan` class includes two crucial methods for managing connections between interfaces and event objects: **`parseCommands`** and **`isValidCommand`**.

## How It Works

When the interface generates a JSON command, it follows this structure:

```json
{
    "id": "addevent",
    "description": "Add an event",
    "args": {
        "title": "<title>",
        "location": "<location>",
        "capacity": "<capacity>",
        "date": "<date>",
        "time": "<time>",
        "duration": "<duration>"
    }
}
```

1. The interface calls a callback function with the aforementioned JSON.
2. This callback function verifies the command's validity with all registered classes (e.g., `EventObjectMan`) by invoking the **`isValidCommand`** method.
3. If a registered class accepts the command, the command and its arguments (in JSON format) are forwarded to **`parseCommands`**.
4. **`parseCommands`** acts as a multi-command parser, although in this instance, only one command is processed.
5. **`parseCommands`** executes the command; for our example, it adds a new event based on the specified arguments.
6. It then generates a response and returns it to the caller, which is the callback function in this case.
7. The callback function sends the response to a logging thread and also to the original caller, such as `ConsoleInterface`, which has its own unique identifier.

The above design is generic and will also be utilized for the participant class.
