The goal of this card is to implement an SSH interface.

# DOD (definition of done):
All findings are documented.
A shell client can be run via ssh.

# TODO:
- [x] 1. Spike how to setup an SSH server on Java
- [x] 2. Use ConsoleInterface instead shell program

# Reports:
* A full ssh interface was implemented.
* The ssh shell can support multi commands, for now only `exit`, `help` and `evenman` have been added.
* All interfaces was updated to support networks out/in and local out/in
* several improvements were applied to the code.
* Some containers were updated according requirements.
* Instead using ConsoleInterface in ssh shell , a copy of the ConsoleInterface was added to SshInterface as a private class.
* A ssh client to test the ssh server was implemented.
* To connect to eventman ssh server :
